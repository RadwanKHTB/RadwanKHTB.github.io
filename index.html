      <p class="text">
        I am a 18 year old student studying at Hanze University of Applied Sciences. I am interested in Software Engineering and Artifical Intelligance. The assignment asked to show ourselves rather than tell and I thought what better than to code my own website with the knowledge that I have aswell as some new things I recently picked up. I have always had a fondness for computers and electronics in general. I started with scratch and eventually worked my up to higher level languages.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        The reason I am in Marketing Management and not Computer Science is because I would like to be able to run my own company one day and I feel like there are more resources for studying CS alone than there are for any other major. My dad is a business owner so as expected he places a heavy emphasis on the business world, so I took him up on his advice and here I am.
